    ">Dynamic programming is a technique for efficiently implementing a recursive algorithm by storing partial results. The trick is seeing whether the naive recursive algorithm computes the same subproblems over and over and over again. If so, storing the answer for each subproblems in a table to look up instead of recompute can lead to an efficient algorithm. Start with a recursive algorithm or definition. Only once we have a correct recursive algorithm do we worry about speeding it up by using a results matrix. Dynamic programming is generally the right method for optimization problems on combinatorial objects that have an inherent left to right order among components. nents. Left-to-right objects includes: character strings, rooted trees, polygons, and integer sequences."
